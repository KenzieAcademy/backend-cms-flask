# Introduction to Relational Database Design

## Learning Objectives

- Relational data model
- Relational database design


## Introduction

The first commercially available relational database management system was released in 1979, but relational database
management systems remain the most prevalent type of database management system to this day. Their success is based on
the relational data model invented in 1970. In the decades since the relational data model was first introduced, many
relational database management systems have emerged; however, all are fundamentally similar thanks to the shared
foundation the relational data model provides.

## Assignment

Apply what weâ€™ve learned about the relational database model and database design to create the logical model of
a content management system (CMS) using the database design standard notation introduced in the readings. The analysis
phase of database design has already been completed and the requirements gathered from analysis are provided below.

### Standard Notation Example

The example was taken from the readings. Follow this convention for you assignment.

```text
courses (id, name, code, course prerequisites
students (id, first_name, surname, address, age
books (id, ISBN, title, price, quantity_in_stock 
```
- omitted closing parenthesis indicates design is incomplete  
- primary key fields are indicated by underlining the field  
- foreign key fields are indicated with dashed underline
- composite key fields are indicated by underling all keys involved
